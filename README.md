Repository for a food ordering static website with HTML, SASS with cool animations


In this project I had been given an outline of what need to be included. 
To be included are;

● Homepage
● 4x Menu Page ( For each restaurant)
● Header & Footer same as all pages. 

As instructed for the effects on the pages, there are to be no javascript or CSS library used to creation animations or transitions. 
For the pages the instructions as set in the brief are as follows:

Buttons

● When hovering, the background color of the main buttons should lighten slightly. The
drop shadow should also be more visible.
● Eventually, visitors will be able to save their favorite menus. For that, a heart-shaped
Like button is present on the model. When you click on it, it should fill up gradually.
For this first version, the effect can appear on hovering on desktop instead of
clicking.

Home Page

● When the application has more menus, a loading spinner will be necessary. On this
mock-up, we would like to have a preview of it. It will have to appear for 1 to 3
seconds when you arrive on the home page, cover the whole screen, and use CSS
animations (no library). The design of this loader is not defined, so any proposal is
welcome as long as it is consistent with the graphic charter.


Menu Pages

● When arriving on the page, the dishes should appear gradually with a slight time lag.
They may appear either one by one or by group Starter, Main course, and Dessert.
An example of the expected effect is provided.
● The visitor can add the dishes he wishes to his order by clicking on them. A small
checkmark will appear to the right of the dish. This tick should slide from right to left.
For this first version, the effect can be displayed on hovering on desktop instead of
clicking. If the title of the dish is too long, it will have to be trimmed with suspension
points. An example of the expected effect is provided.


I have included a link for my website here:
